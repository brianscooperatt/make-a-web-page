	<b>What is HTML Markup?</b><br>
	<li>HTML markup is made up of <b>"tags"</b> and <b>"elements."</b></li>
	<li>The tags and the content in between the tags makes up the <b>ELEMENT</b>.</li>
	<li>Some common tags that go between < and > include:</li>

	1. B tag (bold)<br>
	2. EM tag (italics)<br>
	3. A tag (anchor tag for making links)<br>
	4. IMG tag (images)<br>
	5. ALT tag (alternate text to more clearly define in words what an image is about - often used for broken requests or for the blind<br>
	6. BR tag (break tag) which is an <b><em>INLINE</em></b> tag.<br>
	7. P tag (paragraph tag) which is a <b><em>BLOCK</em></b> tag.<br>
	<br>
		<div class="notebox">
		<b>***Note***</b>: INLINE and BLOCK tags form an <em>invisible</em> box around the text/content.
		</div>
	<p>
	<b>What are HTML Attributes?</b> - HTML attributes (attr) go inside of tags to change things such as font size, color, etc.
	</p>

  	<b><h2>LESSON 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2></b>
	</p>
	</div>

  	<div class="content">
      <p>
    <b>- A Website is like a House</b>-The HTML is the structure of the home including the walls and frame, CSS is the style of the home including the color and layout, and Java Script is the interactive part of the home including remote controls, TV's, etc.' 
  	</p>
    <p>
    <b>- Boxes Everywhere!</b>- Everything you see on Websites can be broken down into boxes and within those boxes, the content can be changed using HTML, CSS and Java Script. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
    <b>- Developer Tools (in the Browser)</b>- HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
  	</p>

  	<p>
    <b>- The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b> -
The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... 
In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...
  	</p>

  	<p>
    <b>- The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b> - When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
